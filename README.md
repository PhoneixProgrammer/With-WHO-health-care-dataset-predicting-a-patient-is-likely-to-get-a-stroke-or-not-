# With-WHO-health-care-dataset-predicting-a-patient-is-likely-to-get-a-stroke-or-not-
Using the WHO data, predicting whether a patient is likely to get a stroke on input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, and others.
Working with the imbalanced dataset.
1. Trained a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithm to set a baseline performance. Used ROC AUC and average precision metrics for model evaluation. Also showing precision and recall for both the classes. 
2. Now we balanced the dataset using different techniques-random undersampling, random oversampling, edited nearest neighbors and SMOTE. 
3. And again train the model with a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithm and compare the model performance from before.
4. Finding out important features using random forest and gradient boosting algorithm and how the different data balancing techniques improved the performance of the model.
